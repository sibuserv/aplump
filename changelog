--- v1.1 (2018-xx-xx) ---
* Improve static build of openssl package.
* Improve notifications during build of packages.
* Simplify usage of *.patch files: apply them directly from UnpackSources()
  function instead of forcing of usage of additional scripts (see *-patches.sh).
* Simplify GetSources() function: do not check the size of tarballs because
  the checkup of checksum should be enough.

* First public release.
